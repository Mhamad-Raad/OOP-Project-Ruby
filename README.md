# 📖 Getting Started <a name="about-project"></a>
Imagine that you are the librarian of OOP University, and you need a tool to record what books are in the library and who borrows them. The app that you will create will allow you to:

- Add new students or teachers.
- Add new books.
- Save records of who borrowed a given book and when.

And all of this will be built in a beautiful and well-organized way!
